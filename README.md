BULLETIN:-

Bulletin is a news website, which incorporates exciting features using React and React Router. With the implementation of infinite scroll and a top-loading bar, I have strived to enhance user experience and provide a seamless browsing journey. Leveraging external API, I have established a direct connection to the servers of esteemed news channels like BBC, Aajtak, CNN and many more, ensuring that the news displayed on my website is live and up-to-date. To cater to diverse interests, I have categorized the news into various sections, such as politics, sports, health, technology, and more. Users can effortlessly access their preferred news topics or choose to view all the news at once on the homepage.
